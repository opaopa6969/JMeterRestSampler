- Build
Add a <i>properties/${user.name}.properties</i> file and define the <i>jmeter.home</i> property. Then run ant.
${user.name} is the username of the logged in user.
This code has been tested with JMeter 2.5 (http://archive.apache.org/dist/jakarta/jmeter/binaries/jakarta-jmeter-2.5.tgz)

- Install
Edit the ${jmeter.home}/bin/user.properties and set the searh_paths property to the location of the JMeterRestSampler.java file:
  search_paths=/path/to/JMeterRestSampler.jar
Alternatively, copy the JMeterRestSampler.jar in the directory ${jmeter.home}/lib/ext

If installation is successful, when starting JMeter, the Rest Sampler and JMX Sampler should be available in the Add/Sampler ThreadGroup context popup menu.

- Eclipse project
To successfully compile the project within Eclipse, once imported, you need to define two workspace
variables: JMETER_HOME and ANT_HOME to respectively point to your JMeter home and Ant home directories.

- License
The software is licensed using a BSD license.

- Disclaimer
JMeterRestSampler is no more than a toy to prove the concept of Robustness testing via JMeter.
I am not intentioned to improve it in the foreseeable future.
